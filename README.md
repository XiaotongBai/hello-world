# hello-world
My first repository
Dear Princess Celestia:
  Today I learned how to start a repository! Github is awsomazing!
  Besides, I learned that Sharing is also an element of friendship. 
  Sharing codes on Github can bring the joy of cooperation and make
a lot of friends!
                                             Your faithful student,
                                                          Xiao Tong
